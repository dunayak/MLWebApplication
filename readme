## Deploying ML Model using Flask
This is a university project to demonstrate the Machine Learning model using Flask API

### Prerequisites
You must have Pandas, Scikit Learn and Flask (for API) installed.

Flask version: 0.12.2
conda install flask=0.12.2  (or) pip install Flask==0.12.2

### Project Structure
This project has four major parts :
1. mlmodel.py - This contains code for Machine Learning model to predict the right label of the honey sample.
2. webapp.py - This contains Flask APIs that accepts the rdata file made of honey samples collected by food authenticity investigations that use infrared (NIR) spectroscopy
3. template - This contains the HTML template (index.html), which shows about information/ project details and also allows user to upload the dataset and choose to predict.

4. static - There is a css folder under this and which has a style.css file which is being used in index.html file as styling template.

### Step to run the project
1. Make sure to navigate to the project home directory. 
Create the machine learning model by executing below command from terminal/ command prompt 
```
python mlmodel.py
```
This would create a model into a file mlmodel.pkl

2. Run webapp.py using below command to start Flask API
```
python webapp.py
```
By default, flask will run on port 5000.

3. Navigate to URL http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (or) http://localhost:5000

You should be able to view the homepage.

- After going through the information pages, please navigate to Prediction tab
-

If everything goes well, you should  be able to see the predcited salary vaule on the HTML page!
check the output here: http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict
